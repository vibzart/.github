# Vibz.Art Studio

### Ancient Wisdom. Modern Code. 🕉️ ⚙️

Vibz.Art is a SOTA technology studio dedicated to building the infrastructure for ancient Indian knowledge systems. We bridge the gap between Siddhantic precision and modern engineering.

---

## 🏛️ Our Mission
We believe that sacred knowledge should be **freely computable**. Our work focuses on three core pillars:
1. **Computational Astronomy:** Precision engines for Vedic time-keeping.
2. **Linguistic AI:** Advanced NLP and LLMs for Sanskrit and classical languages.
3. **Digital Seva:** Open-source frameworks for the preservation of 30M+ deteriorating manuscripts.

## 🚀 Flagship Initiatives

### [Lilavati](https://github.com/vibz-art/lilavati)
**The Infrastructure of Time.** A high-performance Rust engine for Panchang computation. Validated against NASA JPL DE441 ephemeris and the Surya Siddhanta. 
* *Status:* Open Sourcing Q1 2026
* *Tech:* Rust, WebAssembly, REST API

### [Gargi](https://github.com/vibz-art/gargi)
**Digital Seva at Scale.** Named after the Vedic philosopher Gargi Vachaknavi, this is a crowdsourced framework for the digitization, OCR, and translation of ancient manuscripts.
* *Status:* Active Development
* *Tech:* Python, TypeScript, Computer Vision

### [Sanskrit NLP](https://github.com/vibz-art/sanskrit-models)
**Beyond Tokenization.**
Research into encoding Paninian grammar rules (Ashtadhyayi) into transformer architectures to solve the "low-resource" barrier for Sanskrit AI.

## 🛠️ Stack & Standards
We build for the next millennium. That requires rigors:
* **Precision:** High-precision decimal arithmetic for astronomical constants.
* **Performance:** Core engines built in Rust for memory safety and speed.
* **Open Source:** We believe in *Vidya Daan*—the gift of knowledge. All our core engines are open-source.

## 🤝 Join the Movement
We are looking for Engineers, Sanskrit Scholars, and Data Scientists who believe that tradition and technology are not opposites, but two sides of the same coin.
