# Vibz.art

### Ancient Wisdom. Modern Code. 

**Vibz.art is a technology company building the computational infrastructure for ancient Indian knowledge systems.** We engineer the foundational layer where deep tech meets Vedic science. From training language models on classical Sanskrit to building high-precision astronomical engines, we apply rigorous, world-class software architecture to make sacred heritage accessible, computable, and enduring.

## 🏛️ Core Infrastructure
We treat historical texts and ancient sciences not just as literature, but as advanced computational frameworks. Our work spans three core engineering pillars:

1. **Computational Astronomy:** Sub-arcsecond precision engines for Vedic time-keeping and ephemeris calculation.
2. **Linguistic AI & NLP:** Foundational models and custom tokenizers built specifically for the morphological complexity of Sanskrit.
3. **Enterprise Digital Seva:** Scalable frameworks, proprietary OCR, and data pipelines for the preservation and translation of ancient manuscripts.

## 🚀 Flagship Open-Source Projects

### [Lilavati](https://github.com/vibz-art/lilavati)
**The Infrastructure of Sacred Time.** A high-performance, enterprise-grade Rust engine for Panchang computation. Validated against NASA JPL ephemeris and the Surya Siddhanta, Lilavati provides the calendar infrastructure layer for global applications requiring true astronomical exactitude.
* **Tech:** Rust, REST API, WebAssembly
* **Focus:** High-precision decimal arithmetic, memory safety, zero floating-point drift.

### [Sanskrit Foundation Models](https://github.com/vibz-art/sanskrit-models)
**Bridging Panini and Transformers.** Research and development into making Sanskrit a high-resource computable language. We are exploring techniques like custom tokenizers and task-specific lightweight architectures to encode the world's most rigorous formal grammar into modern LLMs.
* **Tech:** PyTorch, Custom Tokenization, MLOps
* **Focus:** Low-resource NLP, morphological parsing, efficient fine-tuning.

## ⚙️ Our Engineering Ethos
> *The ancients got it right in verse. We honor that by getting it right in code.*

We build for the next millennium. That requires stripping away the proprietary walls around foundational sacred knowledge and replacing them with robust, open-source engineering. 

* **Precision over approximation.**
* **Open source over walled gardens.**
* **Rigorous engineering over exoticism.**
